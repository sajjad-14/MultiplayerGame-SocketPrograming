# Multiplayer Tic Tac Toe Game with Socket Programming üéÆ

This project implements a multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game using socket programming in Python. It allows clients to connect to a central server and engage in a game of Tic Tac Toe while displaying the ping of the game on the client's screen. This project serves as an excellent tool to comprehend networking concepts through programming.

## Features

- **Multiplayer Functionality:** Connect multiple clients to a central server to play Tic Tac Toe.
- **Socket Programming:** Utilizes sockets for communication between the server and clients.
- **Ping Display:** Shows the ping of the game on the client's screen for better network understanding.

## Getting Started

To run this game on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system (preferably Python 3.x). üêç

### Installation

- Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sajjad-14/MultiplayerGame-SocketPrograming.git
   ```

### Usage

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

2. Run the client:
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play Tic Tac Toe with another connected client.

## Understanding Networking Concepts

This project serves as an educational resource for learning networking concepts through practical programming. By exploring the codebase and observing the communication between the server and clients, users can gain insights into socket programming, client-server architecture, and understanding ping within a networked environment. üñ•Ô∏è
